In the alternative heuristic function:

1. The current state is dead (unsolvable) when one of the following situations happen:
(a) There exists a free box (not in storage) against a wall along which there is no empty strorage. 
(b) There exists a free box stuck between a wall and an objection.
(c) There exists a free box stuck between a wall and another box.
If the state is dead, we set the heuristic to float("inf").

2. If the current state is not dead, 
we calculate the heuristic by adding up
the sum of Manhattan distances between each box and their nearest storage and 
the sum of Manhattan distances between each robots and their nearest box.


In anytime weighted A* function: 

3. wrapped_fval_function = (lambda sN: fval_function(sN, weight)), 
where the weight = 0.6 * weight during every iteration.
